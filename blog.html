											EXCELLENCE IN LEADERSHIP STYLE

                    One of the things that we at the Future Nigeria have identified is the right attitude of exhibiting the Leadership style and Character which is common in most of us and we lack the knowledge of learning the ways of what we should be doing in order to have the right leadership attitude in the economy of Nigeria today everyone wants to be a leader but some do not know or neither understand the quality and assets of what a leader who wants to take charge of the Nigerian continent on what he should be generally possessing, the kind of attitude the person should develop and the right skills of what and how the society will generally be of benefit and what are the things they should be doing to show that they are leaders and they are fully capable or enough to lead the Nigerian and African community and see on how it can even be extended to the global community in the terms of their leadership.

											EDUCATION
										</h4>
                  <p>
                    UNESCO reports that of all the regions of the world, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of school exclusion, with more than one-fifth of children aged 6-11 out of school, as well as one-third of youth aged 12-14 and 60% of youth aged 15-17. With the continent’s overall youth population estimated to reach 452 million by 2050, the continent’s youth bulge represents both an opportunity and a risk if improperly educated. Beyond access to basic education, there is an urgent need to devise a strategy for futuristic higher education on the continent, to enhance research and productivity across all sectors and the future Nigeria team want to use this ability to tackle the problem if possible through the means of information communication technology that the people of the Nigerian community will benefit from.

                    Development aid to Nigeria has been low compared to other African countries and has reduced considerably since its peak in 2006. Net overseas development aid was roughly USD 11 billion in 2006, 2 billion in 2007 and less than 1 billion in 2008.Half of this was for health and population projects/program's,and one quarter for debt relief.Both multilateral agencies and bilateral donors have been active in Nigeria. Among the multilateral donors, the UN system stands out.USAid is the largest of the donors, followed by DFID. Nigeria has recently undergone economic reforms, and although outside actors, such as donors, regional organizations (AU, NEPAD and ECOWAS),the Nigerian Diaspora and international private companies inside and outside the oil sector  have been important influences, research indicates that domestic forces have been the main drivers of the reform (Utomi et al. 2007).

                  <p>
                    Types of unemployment in Nigeria Frictional unemployment This type of unemployment is caused by industrial friction.There are jobs but people can’t fill find them because they don’t have the skills or are unaware of the existence of the jobs.This occurs due to ignorance,immobility of labor, shortage of raw materials, and breakdown in machinery. Residual unemployment This type of joblessness is caused by old age, physical or mental disability, irresponsible attitude towards the job and inadequate training. Structural unemployment This type of unemployment is caused by the shift in the country's economy causing a mismatch between the skills required by employers and the skills proposed by employees. Future Nigeria want to use this means to ensure that the rate of unemployment is reduced across different parts of the country.

											PEACE AND SECURITY
										</h4>
                  <p>
                     African countries including the federal republic of Nigeria have been synonymous with conflicts for several decades, ranging from the agitations of local militia, civil wars, political conflicts, ethnic and religious conflicts to the spread of violent extremism. The number of protests and riots on the continent have increased more than tenfold in the last decade, while terrorist attacks are estimated to have increased more than 1000%, in a 2017 report issued by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. The implications of these crises are stark – the United Nations High Commissoner for Refugees estimates that more than 26 % of the world’s refugees (18 million people) are in sub-Saharan Africa, while the continent has the highest number of internally displaced persons in the world; more than five times the number of refugees. As former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, succinctly put it, “there can be no security without development and no development without security”.

                  <p>
                   Evident decline in the global market value of Africa’s natural resources, attention is fast shifting back towards the much-neglected but indispensable agriculture sector. Farming is estimated to be the primary source of income for more than 60% of African families, yet with more than half of the world’s uncultivated land (more than 200 million hectares) present on the continent. Africa’s fledgling agricultural industry needs massive investment in critical technology, research for higher crop yield, land reform to empower local farmers, and improved trade policies to ensure higher returns for farmers. No sector has higher potential to lift people out of poverty than agriculture.

                    The Federal Ministry of Works is currently working to improve various sections of the Federal highway network.This effort includes 194 on-going projects which will involve a total cost of about USD 9 billion. The Public Private-Partnership Department, a department of the Ministry, has developed outline business cases for viable and bankable major highways (brownfields)and proposed new alignments(greenfields) to attract the private sector and foreign direct investment (FDI).However, challenges still remain. Two pilot PPP projects initiated by the Ministry (Lagos–Ibadan Expressway and Gutto–Bagana Bridge across the Benue River) were stalled due to the concessionaires’ inability to obtain the stipulated funding required. Government is currently making efforts to revive the projects.The 1970 Federal Airport Development Plan (ADP) served as the basis for the growth and development of airports in Nigeria.

                      ENDING OF CORRUPTION/POVERTY

                  <p>
                    Once again, the chronic issue of corruption has come to the fore; corruption is everywhere in Nigeria and it is the major cause of poverty. It is associated with lower levels of economic development, slower economic growth, poverty and conflicts. From political circles to business boardrooms, educational institutions, the health and judicial sectors, and even the “holiest” places, our religious institutions-the list is endless. This vice is literally dismembering our country. It has become a deep-rooted norm in every sector. Occurring in different forms; giving the so called Egunje a local parlance for bribes; being favoured at the expense of a more qualified and experienced colleague; nepotism or giving favours in exchange for gratifications; and in some schools, a student cannot pass examinations without bribing the teachers. How about parents buying examination papers for their wards in advance? Perhaps the most obvious institution where we see the manifestation of corruption in full glare in our everyday life is in government institutions particularly the Police Force, the Customs and the civil service.
