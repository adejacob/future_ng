                    Nigeria a country which is located in the west region of africa and was colonized by the Great Britain on the 1st of October 1960 is recognized as the giant of africa all over the world since the former administration of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan but yet we are faced with so many numerous challenges like killing, slavery, corruption, kidnapping, sexual abuse, education and bad leadership that has drawn the country to the stage it is today where so many youths are being killed, poor education is currently taken place in schools and this happens when teachers are not being paid salaries or there is misappropriation of funds by the school authority, people are not being employed to the extent that those who are employed sometimes get sacked for different reasons which some of this things has caused high rate of unemployment in the country that youths will want to start stealing or wanting to get themselves found in different activities in order for them to a living and using this to take care of their families and friends who are hungry and does not even know what to do at all . My vision for Nigeria in the future is that - Nigeria should be found as a country that already has and operates on a decentralized government system which this can be only achieved by the President, Legislative and Judiciary of the country by working together hand in hand as a team and passing all accurate information to the people. To see a government where there is free education and healthcare accessible to all citizens of the federal republic of Nigeria. I want to see a country that all the youth of the country has the full understandable knowledge of what technology is all about also using it to develop things for the society. A country where leaders are not corrupt also are patriotic about the lives of humanity found in the country. A country where we can have at least 83.1% or more of our children and youths living across the federal republic of nigeria to be educated and not uneducated according to the united nations which was the rate given to Nigeria concerning uneducated people in the country for 2018. A country that should be seen as the open space or the hub of the world in the sense that people will want to come in and create their business using it as a means of opportunity to people for them to come from different countries to come and start up their business in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and make tremendous impact in the lives of people. The goal of a nigeria youth in the 21st century is understable and it includes:- For them to be wise at each stage of their live as they grow up everyday by taking every opportunity that they find coming across them to the extent they want to share to other community in order to impact their lives. For them to learn to how to be able to come up with ideas, use resources available to them wisely for people to support and publicize it on what ever they are coming up with that it can be used as a means of creating employment for the people of the country which can help reduce the rate of unemployment in the country.To focus on your dreams and have a targeted goal as you progress each day in life and work towards that goal and dont get distracted with anyone attention..Developing ideas that will be of benefit of the nigerian community and if possible extend to the africa or international community that they will want to use it as a recognition for you and your family. Before i end this article I will like to advise all the youth that they should never look down on anyone in any situation or any problem that the person is facing currently because nobody knows what is going to happen in life after on in whatever situation that we find ourselves lets always be there to support people and assist them no one knows whether they might be the ones that will come back tomorrow and help us back. Let me end this article by passing a message all those reading this article especially those who are Nigerians that this country belongs to us all as we are charge towards preparing for the future and making sure that its safe and I hereby that we should all do our best to ensure that we use some of what I have written in the article in order for us to make the vision of the federal republic of Nigeria come true and also in order to ensure that you all achieve all your goals in life as you progress to the next or in the current stage.
